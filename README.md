#Customer Churn Prediction using Neural Network

This project builds a churn prediction model using a given dataset.

## What it does
- Cleans up the data to make it standardized and easy for the model to access
- Scales numeric fields using MinMax scaling.
- Trains a TensorFlow/Keras neural network to predict churn (binary classification).
- Evaluates model performance on a test set (accuracy + confusion matrix).
- Explains predictions using SHAP to show which features influence churn predictions.
